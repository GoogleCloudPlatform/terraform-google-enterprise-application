    Specifies the Cloud Build Worker Pool that will be utilized for triggers created in this step.

    The expected format is:

    If you are using worker pools from a different project, ensure that you grant the
    `roles/cloudbuild.workerPoolUser` role to the Cloud Build Service Agent and the Cloud Build Service Account of the trigger project:
    `service-PROJECT_NUMBER@gcp-sa-cloudbuild.iam.gserviceaccount.com`, `PROJECT_NUMBER@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com`

    If this variable is left undefined, Worker Pool will not be used for the Cloud Build Triggers.
