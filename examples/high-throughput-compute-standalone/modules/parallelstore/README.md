# Google Cloud Parallelstore Module

This module creates a Google Cloud Parallelstore instance, a high-performance filesystem designed for HPC and ML/AI workloads requiring fast data access across multiple compute nodes.

## Usage

```hcl
module "parallelstore" {
  source = "github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/risk-and-research-blueprints//terraform/modules/parallelstore"

  project_id      = "your-project-id"
  location        = "us-central1-a"
  network         = google_compute_network.vpc.id
  deployment_type = "SCRATCH"
  capacity_gib    = 12000
}
```

## Features

- Create Parallelstore instances in either SCRATCH or PERSISTENT deployment types
- Automatically select a zone if only a region is provided
- Customizable capacity based on workload requirements
- Default capacity values optimized for each deployment type
- VPC network connectivity for secure access

## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|----------|
| project_id | The GCP project where the resources will be created | `string` | n/a | yes |
| location | The location (zone) where the Parallelstore instance will be created | `string` | `null` | yes |
| instance_id | The ID of the Parallelstore instance | `string` | `null` | no |
| network | The VPC network to which the Parallelstore instance should be connected | `string` | `"default"` | no |
| deployment_type | Parallelstore Instance deployment type (SCRATCH or PERSISTENT) | `string` | `"SCRATCH"` | no |
| capacity_gib | Custom capacity in GiB for Parallelstore instance | `number` | `null` | no |

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| instance | The created Parallelstore instance |
| instance_id | The ID of the Parallelstore instance |
| instance_name | The name of the Parallelstore instance |
| location | The location where the Parallelstore instance is created |

## Notes

- SCRATCH deployment type is optimized for temporary, high-performance workloads
- PERSISTENT deployment type is designed for long-term data storage with durability
- If no capacity is specified, defaults to 12000 GiB for SCRATCH and 27000 GiB for PERSISTENT
- Requires a properly configured VPC network with Private Service Access
- For best performance, ensure the network MTU is set to 8896

## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|:--------:|
| capacity\_gib | Custom capacity in GiB for Parallelstore instance. If null, defaults to 12000 for SCRATCH and 27000 for PERSISTENT. | `number` | `null` | no |
| deployment\_type | Parallelstore Instance deployment type (SCRATCH or PERSISTENT) | `string` | `"SCRATCH"` | no |
| instance\_id | The ID of the Parallelstore instance. If null, will be set to 'parallelstore-{location}'. | `string` | `null` | no |
| location | The location (zone) where the Parallelstore instance will be created, in the format 'region-zone' e.g., 'us-central1-a' | `string` | `"null"` | no |
| network | The VPC network to which the Parallelstore instance should be connected | `string` | `"default"` | no |
| project\_id | The GCP project where the resources will be created | `string` | n/a | yes |

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| access\_points | List of IPv4 addresses for the Parallelstore access points, required for client-side configuration including Kubernetes PersistentVolumes and Daemonsets |
| capacity\_gib | Provisioned storage capacity of the Parallelstore instance in Gibibytes (GiB), useful for capacity planning and cost estimation |
| daos\_version | Version of the Distributed Application Object Storage (DAOS) software running in the Parallelstore instance, useful for compatibility checks and documentation |
| id | Fully qualified identifier for the Parallelstore resource in format projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/instances/{{instance\_id}}, used in API calls and scripts |
| instance\_id | ID of the Parallelstore instance |
| location | Zone location where the Parallelstore instance is deployed (format: {region}-{zone}), important for co-locating with compute resources |
| name | Fully qualified name of the Parallelstore instance in format projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/instances/{{name}}, used in Google Cloud API calls |
| name\_short | Resource name in the format {{name}} |
| region | Region extracted from the location |
| reserved\_ip\_range | Identifier of the allocated IP address range associated with the Parallelstore private service access connection, used for network planning and troubleshooting |
