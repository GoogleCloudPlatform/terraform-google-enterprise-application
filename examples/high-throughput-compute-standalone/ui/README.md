# Example UI

## Developing

It is recommended to use uv.

To launch you need to point to the config.yaml file generated by terraform. This contains
the configuration of the environment, list of test workloads, and URL references. It is typically ../generated/config.yaml.

```sh
uv run main.py <config.yaml file>
```

To generate the requirements.txt:
```sh
uv export > requirements.txt
```
